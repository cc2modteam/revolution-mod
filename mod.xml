The Revolution mod brings Radar enhancements, a more immersive fog-of-war for island captures and
other enhancements.

Added basic support for a spectator mode extension mod

* Fog of war
* Bomb enemy factories (disabled by default)
* Needlefish rebalance (reduced simulated Radar range)
* AWACS rebalance (~10-12km max range again for a better feel)
* Manta rebalance (less deadly against carriers for more air combat)
* Aircraft RWR sensor
* Bomb enemy factories to slow production

* Barge map/info will now warn when your barge has no delivery waypoints
* Operator screen can show a list of active friendly units from the screen menu
* Operator screen will show island type in command center tooltips
* Loadout screen can now manage loadouts for units on a different carrier
* Helicopter HUD shows informational alerts when hovering (useful for tactical pickup/drops)
